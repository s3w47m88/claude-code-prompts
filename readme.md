Must-haves to add to Claude's memory. Add these one at a time, or open the file and add them. I recommend systemwide.

```
# Always check the readme.md at the beginning of a new session.
# Always utilize GitGuardian.
# Create a pre-commit hook to run GitGuardian. Once this is done, add to the readme.md that this has been done.
# Create a CI/CD pipeline that runs GitGuardian. Once this is done, add to the readme.md that this has been done.
# Maintain a todo.md file. Ensure it has this format: "Feature / Page Section Heading", then indented underneath "[ ] Incomplete task." Or "[x] Completed task." And indenting for sub tasks. When this is completed update the readme.md file to reflect this.
# When instructed with multiple tasks, always add them to todo.md first.
# Always review docs downloaded via Context7 before searching online.
# Always review docs downloaded via Context7 for key packages when you are asked to create a plan for new features, functionality, etc...
```

Tech stack specific:

Railway + Next.js + Supabase

```
# Verify that Railway CLI is installed. Then update the readme.md to note this.
# Verify that Supabase CLI is installed. Then update the readme.md to note this.
# Install the documentation for Next.js via Context7. When this is done update the readme.md to note where it is installed, how to read it, and any key points.
# As you add new core technology ensure the readme.md is updated with a current tech stack.
```

Cloudflare Pages
```
# Prepare this application for deployment to CloudFlare pages.
# Ensure that localStorage is persistent between browser sessions and page refresh. If there is difficulty fall back to JSON files for storage. Unless instructed to use Supabase. Then update the readme to documentation this.
```
