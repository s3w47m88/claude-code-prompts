Must-haves to add to Claude's memory. Add these one at a time, or open the file and add them. I recommend systemwide.

```
# Always check the readme.md at the beginning of a new session.
# Always utilize GitGuardian.
# Create a pre-commit hook to run GitGuardian. Once this is done, add to the readme.md that this has been done.
# Create a CI/CD pipeline that runs GitGuardian. Once this is done, add to the readme.md that this has been done.
# Maintain a todo.md file. Ensure it has this format: "Feature / Page Section Heading", then indented underneath "[ ] Incomplete task." Or "[x] Completed task." And indenting for sub tasks. When this is completed update the readme.md file to reflect this.
# When instructed with multiple tasks, always add them to todo.md first.
```
